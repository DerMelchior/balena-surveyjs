What hardware do I need?
-------------------------------------------

The list of items you’ll need is also included below:

- Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+ (Note: this project will not work with Pi Zero or older devices with < 1GB RAM)
- 16GB Micro-SD Card (we recommend Sandisk Extreme Pro SD cards)
- Display (any Raspberry Pi display will work for this project)
- Micro-USB cable
- Power supply
- Case (optional)


Can you use this balenaDash without the Raspberry Pi display?
-------------------------------------------

Sure! Any HDMI display will work just as well.
